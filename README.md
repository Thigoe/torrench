* **Linux:** Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch

**[Reported by users]**
* **macOS:** Yosemite, Sierra, High Sierra (10.13). [I do not own a Mac hardware, so unable to test it myself. If you find it working on your system (it should), update me?]

**IMPORTANT -** Please keep a close eye on [CHANGELOGS](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). All updates info, addition setup info (whenever required), and everyting else related will be updated there.

#### \* **[D]** Sites hosting illegal content (Disabled) (MUST READ)
By default, searching thepiratebay(TPB)/kickasstorrents(KAT)/SkyTorrents/Nyaa/XBit... from torrench is disabled. The user should configure and enable it to use. I have provided configuration steps, but before moving to configuration, please note the following:

* Using these sites is completely optional. They would never interfere/cause any problems when searching linuxtracker/distowatch.
* Using these sites in many countries is illegal. Using them can get you into un-intended troubles (e.g notices/block from ISP). Read [Legal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay#Legal_issues)
* Neither I, nor the tool shall be held responsible for any action taken against you for using the above-mentioned sites from torrench.
* Illegal searches [examples](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench#searches-considered-illegal)
* [Configuration instructions](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench#configuration-instructions) if you decide to use them.

_Torrench initially began as a python learning project for me. I am sure there are ways to implement code I wrote in a much better/efficient way. Do [let me know](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench#contact). Alternatively, you can also send a pull request. See [Contributing](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)._

## Installation/Building from Source
### Linux

* Requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.4+)
* Arch Users - Can install from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/torrench/)
* Other distro users [Ubuntu,Fedora,Suse,etc...] can use **pip3** (install/upgrade)
```
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade torrench
```
* Alternatively, build from source (python-setuptools)
```bash
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Windows
Windows does not require any additional packages. Everything required to run this software is provided in executable (Does not even require python pre-installed).

* Download latest [torrench executable](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/releases/download/v1.0.61/torrench-1.0.61.exe)
* That's it. Run using cmd/powershell [```> torrench.exe <search>```]

	* NOTE:
		* In windows, the default location for storing [TPB] html files is ```C:\Users\<user>\.torrench\temp```
        * ~~For now, `linuxtacker`, `distrowatch` and `libgen` does not allow adding torrent to client from torrench. A `.torrent` file is downloaded to hard-drive. I was unable to find a way to load `.torrent` to client from torrench. I'll try to figure this out when I'll get time. Till then, torrent should be loaded manually after it is downloaded. Also, if someone has a work-around for the same, let me know?~~ 
        **FIXED in v1.0.61**

### Osx

Please note OSX requires to install package `pyopenssl`:
```
$ pip3 install pyopenssl
```

### Configuration instructions (This section little modded by Thigoe in this fork):
1. Download the [**config.ini**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thigoe/torrench/master/config) file.
	* **Windows -** Copy the config file in ```C:\Users\<user>\.config\torrench\``` (create any missing directories)
	* **Linux -** Default location is ```$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/torrench/```. If ```$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``` is not defined, it fallbacks to ```$HOME/.config/torrench/``` (Create any missing directories).
	* **MacOS -** See minimal setup guide below.
2. Enable it
	* Open config.ini file
	* Set ```enable=1```
	* Save and exit
3. That's it.

* Once setup, config file can be updated using [`$ torrench -U`]. Setting this up manually for the first time is mandatory though.

---

### Loading torrent to client

#### [LINUX/MacOS]
* Requires **[torrench.ini](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/blob/master/torrench.ini)** config file.
    * Default directory: **$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/torrench**
    * Fallback: **$HOME/.config/torrench/**
* Set the default torrent client name in config file.
    * ```CLIENT = <name>```
* Clients tested:
    * Transmission (```transmission-remote```, ```transmission-gtk```, ```transmission-qt```)
    * Deluge (```deluge```, ```deluge-console```)
    * qBittorrent
* If someone tried ```rtorrent```, please report.

* **Setting up ```transmission-remote```**
    * Requires running **transmission-daemon** service
    * Torrent is added to transmission client using **transmission-remote** utitlity.
    * **(IMP)** For AUTHENTICATION - ```$TR_AUTH``` environment variable is used.
        * [TR_AUTH="username:password"]
    * **(IMP)** For PORT/SERVER - Set the PORT and SERVER variable in **[torrench.ini](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/blob/master/torrench.ini)** file accordingly.
        * If ```$TR_AUTH``` or PORT/SERVER are not set, the following (default) values are used:
        * DEFAULTS
            * Username - [None]
            * password - [None]
            * SERVER - localhost (127.0.0.1)
            * PORT - 9091

#### [Windows]
* ~~In windows, by default the magnetic link is opened in browser. If a torrent client is installed, the browser should automatically open the (default) client and load torrent to the client.~~
* Instead of opening torrent in browser, torrent is loaded directly to **default torrent client**. Works for both magnetic links and .torrent files.

### Cross-Site search
It is possible to search multiple sites with a single command (Cross-site search)

#### Sample
`$ torrench -Ctisx 'ubuntu'`

![cross-site](images/screenshots/cross.gif)

**USAGE**
-  Use `-C` argument to search multiple sites. Example: `$ torrench -Ctlxsb 'fedora'`
- By default, the results are merged into a **single table**. To view results separately, use `--no-merge` argument. This would give an option to select site, followed by torrent selection.
- By default the results are merged on the basis of order of fetch.
        Eg: If TPB is fetched first followed by KAT, final table will have all results of TPB followed by KAT.
        To sort results, use `--sort` argument. Results are sorted on basis of **seeds**.
- As of now, **linuxtracker, distrowatch and libgen are not supported.** Rest all can be used for cross-site.

---

### Note
* A torrent might take long to fetch results. I have generally faced this issue when running torrench for the first time. When this happens:
	* Abort the ongoing search [Ctrl+C]
	* Search again. The second time generally works fine.
* KAT Proxy is quite shaky, and might not work at all times. I have been unable to find any reliable KAT proxy. Consider alternatives if they do not work.
* Searching **LibGen** - LibGen allows searching for Ebooks using book's **ISBN-10 number only**. Searching using book title is not supported. (LibGen API does not allow searching using title). A book's ISBN-10 number can be found with a simple google search, or on websites like Amazon.

## Disclaimer
This tool fetches torrent and details from already existing torrent website(s). I do not take any responsibility for availability of any kind of torrent data, or/and hosting of any torrent website(s). Also, I am  not responsible for closing of any of the torrent website(s). As long as the website(s) (proxies) are available, data will be fetched.

## Known issues
* **Distorted results**: Some websites displaying non-english characters can distort the resulting table. To properly align tables which contain wide characters (typically fullwidth glyphs from Chinese, Japanese or Korean languages), the user should install `wcwidth` library.

`$ sudo pip3 install wcwidth`
